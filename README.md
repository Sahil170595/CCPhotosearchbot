# CCPhotosearchBot

**CCPhotosearchBot** is a fully serverless, cloud-native photo search and retrieval bot that runs **entirely on AWS**.  
It leverages **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Rekognition, and Amazon OpenSearch Service** to enable fast, scalable, and intelligent photo search using natural language or keywords.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is designed to be **end-to-end serverless**:

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äî stores the raw image dataset.  
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äî handles query processing, feature extraction, and orchestration between services.  
- **Amazon Rekognition** ‚Äî performs automated image tagging, labeling, and metadata generation.  
- **Amazon OpenSearch Service (Elasticsearch)** ‚Äî indexes image embeddings and supports semantic/natural language search.  
- **Amazon API Gateway** ‚Äî exposes REST endpoints so users (or chat platforms like Slack/Telegram) can interact with the bot.  

**High-level flow:**

## üöÄ Features

- **Serverless**: Zero infrastructure management, fully managed AWS stack.  
- **Scalable**: Handles large-scale image datasets with elastic scaling.  
- **Intelligent Tagging**: Automatically extracts labels and metadata from images using Rekognition.  
- **Semantic Search**: Users can query with natural language or keywords (e.g., ‚Äúdogs playing in a park‚Äù).  
- **Integration-Ready**: Easy to connect with chatbots, messaging platforms, or custom frontends.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Because CCPhotosearchBot is **fully AWS-native**, there‚Äôs no local run required.  

1. **Upload Images**  
   Place your images into the configured **S3 bucket**.  

2. **Send a Query**  
   Use the API Gateway endpoint (e.g., via cURL, Postman, or chat integration):  
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-endpoint>/search \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"query": "Find pictures of cats on a sofa"}'


3. **Get Results**
   The system searches embeddings in OpenSearch, enriches with Rekognition labels, and returns the top matching S3 image URLs.

## üìä Example Query

**Input:**

```
"Find pictures of cats sitting on a sofa"
```

**Output:**

* s3://ccphotosearchbot/images/cat\_1.jpg
* s3://ccphotosearchbot/images/cat\_2.jpg
* s3://ccphotosearchbot/images/cat\_3.jpg

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

The stack can be deployed using the **AWS Management Console**, **CloudFormation**, or the **Serverless Framework**.

* Configure an **S3 bucket** for images.
* Deploy **Lambda functions** for query processing.
* Set up **Rekognition** for auto-labeling.
* Index image embeddings in **OpenSearch Service**.
* Expose the API via **API Gateway**.

---

## üìä Future Enhancements

* **Multilingual search** ‚Äî allow queries in multiple languages.
* **Advanced embeddings** ‚Äî integrate CLIP/BLIP via AWS SageMaker.
* **Dashboard** ‚Äî build a web-based UI for image upload and search visualization.
* **Analytics** ‚Äî track query usage, top searched categories, and trends.

## ‚ú® Acknowledgements

This project demonstrates how to build a **cloud-native, serverless photo search system** entirely with AWS services.
It showcases the power of combining **computer vision (Rekognition)**, **semantic indexing (OpenSearch)**, and **serverless orchestration (Lambda + API Gateway)** into one seamless bot.
